# Development of a Lassa Fever Outbreak Prediction System Using LSTM and Gradient Boosting

## Objective
To simulate and model the prediction of Lassa fever outbreaks using LSTM for time-series forecasting and XGBoost for tabular data analysis.

## Simulation Type
Time-Series Simulation / Predictive Modelling

## Types of Dataset
1. Epidemiological data
2. environmental factors
3. clinical records
4. historical outbreak data

## Possible Sources for Dataset
1. WHO databases
2. government health agencies
3. local health monitoring systems
4. publicly available health datasets

## Dataset URLs
1. https://www.who.int/health-topics/lassa-fever
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lassa-fever-datasets
3. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT
4. https://www.healthdata.org/

## Setup Instructions
1. 1. Collect historical outbreak data and environmental factors
2. 2. Preprocess time-series data for LSTM input
3. 3. Preprocess tabular data for XGBoost analysis
4. 4. Train LSTM for forecasting outbreak patterns and XGBoost for prediction based on environmental and clinical factors
5. 5. Validate the models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Implementation Guide
1. 1. Apply LSTM for time-series forecasting on outbreak data (e.g., predicting next outbreaks based on previous trends)
2. 2. Train XGBoost on tabular data to predict outbreak likelihood based on clinical and environmental variables
3. 3. Compare the performance of the hybrid model (LSTM + XGBoost) with single model approaches using metrics like ROC AUC, precision, and recall
4. 4. Implement a simulation to predict future outbreaks and test the model on unseen data

## Expected Output(s)
1. 1. Predictive accuracy of Lassa fever outbreaks based on historical data
2. 2. Evaluation of the hybrid modelâ€™s forecasting ability (LSTM for time-series
3. XGBoost for tabular prediction)
4. 3. Comparison of performance metrics (e.g.
5. ROC AUC
6. precision
7. recall
8. F1-score)
9. 4. Forecasts of future Lassa fever outbreaks based on simulated scenarios
